Just woke up from napping after class ended

Don't have much time left

I have read over the Lab and am researching concepts that I need to implement so I understand them better

I have a general idea of the layout(IG style grids, with genre names, single html file so im gonna create expanding content boxes) 

I'm gonna start freestyling the code until I can't

writing html sections for different genres, 

using unique class names this time so each content area will have more customizability

this will probably require me to do a lot of copy pasting though

Log 3 - 9:25
probably shouldn't have napped

not gonna try fixing the font issue, 

the scale of my original idea was too big

Log 4 - 10pm
fixed font issue, linking in html works @import does not

@media needs to be later in the code

added general classes to make things easier lol

log 5 10:16pm
fonts are kinda ugly
